/* The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is used to solve a set of different congruent equations with one variable 
but different moduli which are relatively prime as shown below: 

congruent : Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo m if their difference a–b is divisible by the integer m.
It is then said that a is congruent to b modulo m, and this statement is written in the symbolic form a≡b (mod m). 
Such a relation is called a congruence.
