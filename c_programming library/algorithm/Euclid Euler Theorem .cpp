/* For every positive integer 'a' & 'n', which are said to be  relatively prime, then a^Ф(n) = I mod n. 
Euler's Theorem
Example 1: Prove Euler's theorem hold true for a=3 and n=10.
Solution:
Given: a=3 and n=10.
a(n) = 1 (mod n)
39(10) = 1 (mod 10)
Φ(10) = 4 // according to euler totient function 
34 = 1 (mod 10)
81 = 1 (mod 10)
Therefore, Euler's theorem holds true for a=3 and n=10.
